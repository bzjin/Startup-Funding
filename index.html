		<h1>How are Startups Being Funded?</h1>

		<div class="col-md-12">
		<p> Which states do you think have the most well-funded startups? If we had to guess, states with high populations and dense cities would make sense; states like California and New York would jump immediately to mind. To normalize this sort of bias, the following map shows the total money raised in each state's startups divided by population. This map reveals a couple surprises to us - yes, California and New York continue to dominant in startups, but so do <span id="Colorado">Colorado</span>, <span id="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</span>, <span id="Connecticut">Connecticut</span>, and <span id="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</span>.</p>

		<div class="col-md-12">
		<p> Which industries have the most well-funded startups? Where are these industries found? Once again, as expected, California, New York, and Massachusetts dominant many industries. We can also see some surprises, however. Illinois, for instance, supports a significant fraction of pharmaceuticals. Retailing looks like its dominated by South Africa and other countries besides the United States. Indiana dominants agriculture, and Oklahoma takes oil and gas.</p>
